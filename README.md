The Coding Workstations are comprised of small repetitive coding prompts derived from the ideology/pedagogy of the [cThink](https://github.com/getromandev/cThink) platform. The goal is to provide students with visual, audio, and kinesthetic learning types, an opportunity to get their hands dirty and acquire a level of competency with lite Computer Science & Javascript fundamentals.

### Steps for Instructors
____________________________________________________________________________________
1. Set up tables facing each other that resembles a workstation.
2. Label each table with the appropriate coding station tag.
3. Prompt the students that the end goal is to complete each coding workstation
4. In order to pass students must complete all the prompts for each coding workstation then tested on those prompts via live coding, proctored by the instructor.
    - Each coding work station is worth `[x]` points.
    - Each student gets `[x]` minutes to complete live coding
5. Once the student has completed a coding work station and passed the live coding test move student to the next table.

### Steps for Students
______________________________________________________________________________________
Each coding workstation lives in a branch with documentation, please follow these steps to check in or out to a specific coding workstation branch.

1. Navigate to one of the following workstations
