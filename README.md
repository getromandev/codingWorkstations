### About me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/heribertoroman/ 
The Coding Workstations are comprised of small repetitive coding prompts derived from the ideology/pedagogy of the [cThink](https://github.com/getromandev/cThink) platform. The goal is to provide students with visual, audio, and kinesthetic learning types, an opportunity to get their hands dirty and acquire a level of competency with lite Computer Science & Javascript fundamentals.

1. Clone this repo to your local machine and work on the solutions

2. Work on the solutions via **Codepen** https://codepen.io/getromandev/pen/VwwBVEY?editors=1010

## Complete Each Mini Prompt
### Primitive Data Types
____________________________________________________________________________________
##### ```Create 2 variables that holds the primitive data type of String```

* one `variable` that holds your `firstName`  
* one `variable` that holds your `lastName`

##### ```Create 2 variables that holds the primitive data type of number```

* one `variable` that holds an `integer`  
* one `variable` that holds a `float`

##### ```Create 2 variables that holds the primitive data type of boolean```

* one `variable` that holds the boolean value of `true`   
* one `variable` that holds the boolean value of `false`

### String Methods
____________________________________________________________________________________
##### ```For the primitive data type String complete the following via console.log()```

* Find the length of your first name variable   
* Find the last character of your last name variable   
* Find the character that sits in index 1 in your first name variable   
* Convert your first name variable to an Array

### Number Methods
____________________________________________________________________________________
##### ```For the primitive data type Number complete the following via console.log()```

* Take your integer variable and raise it to the 4th power
* Convert your number into a string
* Take float variable and round down the number
* Take float variable and round up the number
* Find the square root of your number

### Boolean
____________________________________________________________________________________
##### ```For the primitive data type Boolean complete the following via console.log()```

*  Convert your boolean value from (true to false || false to true) with the bang operator aka logical NOT operator.

### Concatenate Primitive Data Types
____________________________________________________________________________________
##### ```Log out the following to the console via console.log()```

* Hi my name is `[firstName]` `[lastName]` and I am `[integer]` years old, `[boolean]`.

### Functions
____________________________________________________________________________________
##### ```Create a function called myName```

* With two parameters `(firstName, lastName) ` 
* Write a `console.log()` that will log out:
  *  "Hello world my name is `firstName` `lastName`"   

* Call/Invoke the function with two arguments of your choice
