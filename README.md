The Coding Workstations are comprised of small repetitive coding prompts derived from the ideology/pedagogy of the [cThink](https://github.com/getromandev/cThink) platform. The goal is to provide students with visual, audio, and kinesthetic learning types, an opportunity to get their hands dirty and acquire a level of competency with lite Computer Science & Javascript fundamentals.

1. Clone this repo to your local machine and work on the solutions
```or```
2. Work on the solutions via **Codepen** https://codepen.io/getromandev/pen/mddjayR?editors=0010

## Complete Each Mini Prompt
### For Loops
____________________________________________________________________________________
##### ```Create five for loops```

*  Create a for loop that prints the `# 1-100` via `console.log()`
*  Create a for loop that prints the `# 40-101` via `console.log()`
*  Create a for loop that prints the `# 2-86` via `console.log()`
*  Create a for loop that prints the `# 10-0` via `console.log()`

##### ```Create a Nested For Loop```

*  that prints the numbers `0-3` via `console.log('outer loop', index)` 
  *  and inside that loop create a nested for loop that prints the numbers `0-4` via `console.log('inner loop',  index)`

### For Loops
____________________________________________________________________________________
##### ```Write a conditional that solves the following```

*  Write code to check if a person can drive or not.
*  Create a variable called `driverAge` choose any number as the age  
*  To be allowed to drive, someone must be at least `16` years old.
*  Return `true` if the inputted age is `16` or higher. 
*  Return `false` if not.

##### ```Write a conditional statement to find the largest of three numbers```

*  Create 3 variables that each stores a number
*  Use conditionals and comparisons to find which of the 3 is largest 
*  `Console.log` the result
*  Result: “x is the largest number”
