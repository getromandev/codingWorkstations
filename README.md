### About me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/heribertoroman/ 
The Coding Workstations are comprised of small repetitive coding prompts derived from the ideology/pedagogy of the [cThink](https://github.com/getromandev/cThink) platform. The goal is to provide students with visual, audio, and kinesthetic learning types, an opportunity to get their hands dirty and acquire a level of competency with lite Computer Science & Javascript fundamentals.
